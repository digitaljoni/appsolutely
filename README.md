# appsolutely

A Flutter Starter Kit

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application. It is recommended that you download this repo instead of cloning it so that you can start fresh. 

## Renaming For Your Project

You can also use the  following pub package in order to rename your project. You need to install package called rename globally.

```
pub global activate rename
```

1. Extract zip to a directory. 
2. Rename the directory to your new project name. i.e. foodly

```
mv appsolutely foodly
```

3. Go to the directory of your project

```
cd foodly
```

4. Run the rename package with the following parameters

```
pub global run rename --bundleId com.yourdomain.foodly --appname 'Foodly'
```




### Flavor

In order to start the app, you will need to create a class that extends Flavor. Flavors are basically different versions of the app with differenct configurations. Usually Flavors are configured for different environments. However, you can even extend this to other configurations (i.e. full or free versions).

```
class Development extends Flavor {
  @override
  EnvType envType = FlavorType.DEVELOPMENT;
  String baseUrl = 'http://localhost:3000/api/';
}
```

Upon creation, this class will initialize an App object and use this as a parameter for ```InitApp``` obj.

Flavor values are accessible via ```Flavor.instance```

### Application Class

Application class will initialize common objects or methods needed to run the app smoothly. This includes Router, SharedPreferences and more.

## State Management

This project uses Provider as the main state management for the entire app.

## Navigation and Routes

This Flutter Starter Kit uses [Fluro package](https://pub.dev/packages/fluro) which makes routing easier especially with wildcard paths.

Example:

```
router.navigateTo(context,'profile/12345',)
```

For each page, you would need to add routeName and routeHandler. Then add it to the Routes class in order for it to be added to list of routes.

## Themes

Themes are created using [PanacheWeb](https://rxlabz.github.io/panache_web).

## Translations

This project uses [Flutter Intl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=localizely.flutter-intl) to handle managing the translations. It automatically generates code from the .arb files that are located in the ```/lib/l10n/``` directory.

Don't forget to update ```ios/Runner/Info.plist``` when adding a new locale.
